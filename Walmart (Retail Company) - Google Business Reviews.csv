"Absolute, horrible, sloppy, garbage. The last time I went to a Walmart was over 20 yrs ago in a different county. I didn't like it then, and it's sad to see 20 yrs later in a different county, it's the same. Nothing has changed.People damn near crawling over each other through aisles, shelves unorganized, sloppy with merchandise misplaced or on the floor, staff are rude and unhelpful, cashier's are ridiculously slow with lines going from the front of the store all the way to the back of the store. I went at night, during the week, about 30 minutes before closing and it was packed!! 10:30 pm and the store closes at 11:00pm. I had one item and I was on line for 45 minutes.Store front runners for the cashier's are awful and make cashier's run back and forth to ask questions or get help, which holds up the line even more.I'm not impressed with Walmart in-store shopping experience, at all. It'll be another 20 yrs before I go back again. I recommend using their website or order online to pickup or home delivery.",06-01-2023,
"Super ghetto… I do not recommend. Many of the associates have attitudes. Also, it’s extremely packed which I understand is not anyones fault but the store is extremely messy. It is not organized. I asked an associate, “Can you please tell me where the candy is?” She replied, “the candy aisle.” 😒. No, sh— Sherlock. I replied, “Yes, the candy aisle but WHERE IS THE CANDY AISLE?” To which she replied, “On the other side.” She didn’t tell me a number or where it might be near.  Horrible service and the gentleman at the self-checkout acted like we were criminals. Never again. Also, the associates passing with the pallets need to be more aware where they are going, they almost drove over my foot twice!!  Awful. Just awful experience!!FYI… If anyone is looking for the candy, it is in aisle 5 past the produce.",07-01-2023,
"Definitely never coming back!! Even 2 stars is too much to give. Took a little trip up here because I needed school supplies. Let me start off by saying that this whole place is unorganized. The only thing that was organized and that was on one section was the food stuff. It took me about 10-12 mins to find where the supplies were and they barely had any, they were just taking boxes out to fill the sections up. There were no notebooks, no loose leaf, no variety of big binders. Walked around for a bit to see what else I could find & then went to pay and that line wassssss crazy long. It was so long that it was passing and blocking peoples pass way at the hair section row.  Maybe it was cause it was the wknd but still not returning to this one.",05-01-2023,
I was calling this Walmart since Monday until finally someone answer the phone on Thursday but the worker picked the phone up and hanged up the phone on me without saying anything to me.  That's very disrespectful  I already filed a complaint against the store.  These workers need to get fired They are very unprofessional And very Rude.   We don't need workers like that working at Walmart. This is the worst Walmart on long island. If You don't like your job find another job but don't take your anger or whatever issues you having on the customers because that's not our problem.,06-01-2023,
Long linesLimited beetsNo pint container of heavy creamAll frozen pie crust were broken they been in the freezer over 3 months like thatNo frozen stuffed crust pizza with chickenCustomer service had only two workersThen another one came out to helpOther workers walking around the storeI didn't see the store manager walking around the store to check on customer service.Some people refused to wait on the long return line instead they went shopping and they'll check how the long the line is on their way out.,06-01-2023,
"This Walmart is a HOT MESS!!!! Shelves are empty, food is separated into different aisle which gives half expired, half good, and to top it off a worker was using a heavy machinery in the middle of a busy aisle to clean up a small spill 🤔 why not just get a mop 🤷🏽‍♀️ non self check out register’s are limited, and they allegedly want you waiting in clothes aisle, to avoid blocking middle of walkway, I almost got into a fight because of this!! LORD I WOULD NEVER RETURN HERE!!!",02-01-2023,
"This place is always packed and there are times that there is nothing in stock. Looks like the place got robbed. Also the workers hold u at the door trying to Itemize your receipt. Resulting in a long line just to leave the place. There is a parking lot but the there parking spaces are not wide enough, so the car next to you is so close that it's hard to get out of your car and high risk of someone damaging your car by there door hitting your car just so they can get in.",05-01-2023,
I have to give props when it’s due. The store has improved over the last 2 years. I am no longer calling them Ghetto Mark. It’s clean well stocked. The only problem I have is that at 6 in the morning there are no cashiers. I do not like the self checkout. Then they are watching making sure that you pay for everything. Then they want to check your receipts at the door. So for that reason I gave them 3 stars.So I say cashiers for the early bird shoppers,03-01-2023,
This place is like going into a third world country store can't find none of the workers to help you they're all hiding in the back of the store on their phones and the customers and the people that go into the store act like animals they got homeless people standing near the cash registers yelling at people and security doesn't do nothing this place is absolutely crazy compared to the ones in Upstate New York,07-01-2023,
Aug.19The staff unprofessional ask a lady for help she was not willing to help main while the store had 30 mins until closing.Electronic department is gone by 10:15 and there is no body will to help . Two staff members counting the register told me that everyone went home all ready but yet they closings out the department.At the end of the day this store is not the store to come to for anything. Stay away,07-01-2023,
"Worst Walmart I ever been to...Workers Are lazy,Box all in aisles. No plastic bags for fruit and vegetables. Out of the whole store I only ran until 3 workers that took there job seriously. I ask a worker to help me get something and I'm disable she told me she work for Walmart not me. If this is the only way for NYC to have one they need to shut down if not planning to get better.",05-01-2023,
"The food, lunch meat and cheese spoil quick. A month ago I bought Great Value seasoned fries and they were molded. The cashiers are scanning items more than once so I have to watch them scan every item. This store is the worst. I go for the prices but if you want quality you won't get it from this Walmart. I guess you get what you pay for.  They need to shut this Walmart down...",05-01-2023,
Used Sinus Inhaler on the floor which is a crazy health violation. they wouldn’t give me the price shown on the picture claim it’s been used or broke which is why it’s on the clearance. Claimed to not know why it’s on clearance. But that’s clearly just nasty why would I want to use a used sinus inhaler that someone else put their snot and mouth in ?,04-01-2023,
More than half of their luggages don’t have price tags and I must say they have the worst customer service in all the walmart locations have been to. I wait over 1hr just to get help with price tag. They kept pushing me around and didn’t show concern until I had to speak out! Terrible experience for someone that wouldn’t want to make a scene .,07-01-2023,
"Saw two people fighting outside by the parking lot, and then others joining in, laughing and trying to cause a bigger fight. Inside the store, it was very crowded and the merchandise were not all that organized. Lines were all over the place. Overall, pretty messy, very loud, and just chaotic. Will be avoiding this location if possible.",07-01-2023,
"lines are out of control, customers are lining up in the clothing isles.it’s not a normal respond to look into the clothing isles to see where the line ends for the cashier.customers walking up to the cashier will get yelled at by customers lining up IN THE CLOTHING line LOL!CASH OR Credit cards only.lots of items have no price.",07-01-2023,
"Walmart, Green Acres Mall is a place I love to go shopping. Recently I was there with my daughter and grandson and we found every thing we went to shop for. Shoes for him, groceries (those Challah breads were done in three days). Always friendly sales associates nearby to help. It's really a pleasure shopping there.",06-01-2023,
Horrible walmart. It feels unsanitary from the walk-in. I was flabbergasted by how they had the baby formula under what seemed like levels security.  I'm trying to get Enfamil not through TSA. The attitude of some of the workers was mind-blowing. The worst Walmart  ever and I will never be back,07-01-2023,
"I went grocery shopping at  Walmart, every time I visit I have to wonder if stuff is being given away why the cashier lines are so long.Even the self check out lines are no way shorter. I found what I needed ,and I believe I actually spent about a hour and 20 minutes from entering to leaving.",07-01-2023,
"This walmart compared to others is like getting into the ghetto. The store is mainly FULL, a lot of areas are not restock (electronic, food, others...), personal is not polite and are not aware of the concerns of people. I will preferr to go to the ones in NJ or the ones in Nassau county.",08-01-2023,
Shopping here is a nightmare and an absolute frenzy. Some employees seemed helpful but self checkout is run by your typical ABW who for some reason spends time scolding customers about how they don’t listen or pay attention even though they weren’t even properly moving along the queue,06-01-2023,
Tried to call but got no response for more than ten minutes!! How absurd!! You have lost a loyal customer!! I have been going to this Walmart since 2000!! My children and I love this store and it’s a shame how we won’t be able to go back there….Have a good life Walmart (not),07-01-2023,
"one of the best walmart in New York where there are vegetables, fruits and salads! It is simply incomprehensible to the mind that in our century there are supermarkets where there are no healthy vegetables, fruits and salads at all! To the trash of such General Managers!",01-01-2023,
"It is a very attractive and good place to buy. It has a lot of food, homes, kitchen, and supplies that it can take some time to look around and see what you need. Although it is always packed and a lot of people do it may takes some time to walk around and pass through.",05-01-2023,
This based of delivery! My last four deliveries from this store my food came in scented garbage bags! They also mixed raw food with bleach! When I try to call the store I can’t get through. I would not recommend ordering anything for delivery from this store!,04-01-2023,
"Just way too over crowded. Finding parking os like playing musical chairs with cars. When you finally get in, it's as if the store is having a black Friday sale everyday.  I prefer to oder what I need online and leave it at that.",08-01-2023,
Jane at the returns counter is the worst . I was trying to return an item and she said I need to cancel the return on the app which it had no option to . The other guy at the counter completed the return within a couple minutes,02-01-2023,
I go there because I have to. There are boxes all over the aisles waiting to be unpacked making it difficult to push a cart through.  The shelves should be stocked during the off hours. The grocery area is a disaster.,04-01-2023,
Always too crowded. Parking is a nightmare. Half of the young staff do not know where anything is. Not much help there. I don't understand why you have to bring your entire family to Walmart to shop for bread 😕,05-01-2023,
